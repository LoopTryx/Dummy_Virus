# Dummy_Virus
Just a dummy virus. No harm will be done to your system upon running. However, I am not eligible for any damage it does upon your carelessness. This is a prank virus. I am not eligible for any damage done due to YOU using this Python File for malicious purposes. You have been warned.

This is a project made by me for World CyberSecurity Day. You might be wondering, this file is so obvious. No one would fall for this virus. Well, this is how I disguised the virus.

The method I did was that I created a shortcut so that I could edit the file Icon to make it look like a normal PowerPoint App. Which explains the powerpoint icon in this repo.
After you create the shortcut, rename it to the Application you want. It can be Discord, or Minecraft, or Microsoft Word, whatever you want. You also want to search the web for an .ico(Icon file) file of the application, and then go to Properties of the file, link the source of the ico file, and would you look at that! You got an innocent but deadly(not really) fake application!
